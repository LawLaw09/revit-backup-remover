# revit-backup-remover
Removes Revit's autosave backup files

RBR is a small executable software made for Windows operating system written completely in Python. The software is clear, easy to use, simple and effective. The purpose of the software is; it removes Revit backup files (the autosaves that end with .000# for example file.0001.rvt).
The software is very simple to use; you run the software and a file explorer window opens requesting to select the folder that you want to clear the backup files from, once selected you're provided with three options;
1- only .rfa files 2- only .rvt files 3- both
*0 to cancel 
**press enter after typing the number

Note: use this software at your own risk, I've personally tested the software but still not sure how it reacts on other computer with other users

Note2: When selecting the folder know that all subfolders inside will be affected

Note3: Most likely whatever antivirus you have will classify the software as a virus; you can always add an exception in your antivirus software.

Note4: Please first use it on a test folder (or make a copy of the folder you want to clean)
